          <h3>Patrick Oh, Founder and President</h3>
          <p>
            Patrick is a Pomona senior and Philosophy, Politics, and Economics
            Major. He plans to pursue a career in Public Interest law with a
            particular interest in impact litigation and movement lawyering.
            Patrick founded PPLS in the Spring of 2024 after recognizing a lack
            of structured support and resources for students interested in
            pursuing law careers. He envisioned PPLS as a platform to bridge
            this gap, providing mentorship, networking opportunities, and
            educational resources to empower fellow students. As President, he
            oversees all executive board operations such as Alumni MentorxMentee
            Pairings, LSAT study groups, and relations with Pre-Law Advisor
            Susanne Filback.
